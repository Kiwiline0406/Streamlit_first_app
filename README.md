# Streamlit_first_app

This is for a challenge for the Wild Code School named 'Streamlit partie 1 - Les bases'.

We are using a dataset (find it here : "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/taxis.csv") for creating our first new app on Streamlit.

This app should contains :
- a title "Bienvenue sur le site web de {Pr√©nom}"
- a drop-down list with the values of 'pickup_borough' (one of the series of the dataset)
- and then show what choice the user made and display a picture of the pickup borough chosen.

The app is there: "https://wcs-first-app.streamlit.app/"
